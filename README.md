# Growth Mindset
Is how to improve your skills and how to start working on your own, and be creative in your work and find your goal through your journey in growth mindset, to learn new things outside of your comfort zone, using a **growth mindset** to help us grow our new skills, and be succesful in work and life.

 - Self learning.
 - Set a goal in your mind. 
 - Manage your time.
