## Design web pages with CSS

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

**CSS syntax**
CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."


**Three Ways to Insert CSS**

- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

## The goal of a reset stylesheet
 is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on. The general reasoning behind this was discussed in a May 2007 post, if you're interested. Reset styles quite often appear in CSS frameworks, and the original "meyerweb reset" found its way into Blueprint, among others.
