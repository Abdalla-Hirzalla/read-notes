# Introduction to React and Components

# Component

**Component-based architecture** focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties. It provides a higher level of abstraction and divides the problem into sub-problems, each associated with component partitions.

The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure **component reusability**.

### What is a Component?
- **A component is** a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
- **A component is** a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

# React 

**React** has a different approach to data flow & manipulation than other frameworks, and thatâ€™s why it can be difficult at the beginning to understand some concepts like props, state and so on. **React** is a component-based library which divides the UI into little reusable pieces. In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other) and the way to pass data between components is by using props.
- **Props** is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.
- **props** data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

**What are the characteristics of a component?**
- Path.
- Component name.
- Version number.
- Platform.
- Check-in date.
- Component variables.
- Category.


**What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**

Component-based architecture allows for easier, faster, and robust development. Companies with libraries of solid and ready-to-reuse components are able to shorten the duration of projects
