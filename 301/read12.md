## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

Type of Data

## Give a real world example?

If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema

## Give a real world example?

unstructured data, note that some data is considered semi-structured. Semi‐structured data is, as its name suggests, a mix of structured and unstructured data. An example would be an on‐prem Exchange Server. Exchange stores all the email and attachments data within its database.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

Document-oriented database : Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, all are highly scalable, it's just that they require little maintenance for it





## What does SQL stand for?

**SQL**  stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.
## What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key.

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

 logical data structures

## What is a ‘schema’?
A database schema represents the logical configuration of all or part of a relational database. It can exist both as a visual representation and as a set of formulas known as integrity constraints that govern a database.


## What is a NoSQL database?

use it to refer to any non-relational database. Some say the term “NoSQL” stands for “non SQL” while others say it stands for “not only SQL.” Either way, most agree that NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.

## How does it work?

NoSQL databases can store relationship data—they just store it differently than relational databases do. In fact, when compared with SQL databases, many find modeling relationship data in NoSQL databases to be easier than in SQL databases, because related data doesn’t have to be split between tables.

## What is inside of a Mongo database?

MongoDB stores data records as documents which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

 MongoDB is more **flexible** and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).
