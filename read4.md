# Summary

### Structure web pages with HTML 

**Wireframing** is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

**How to make your wireframe good: Three key principles:**
- Maintain clarity
- Gain user confidence
- Simplicity is key


## HTML 
is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

##  semantic

**In JavaScript:** consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

 **in CSS:** consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

**In HTML:** for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page.
