## Introductory HTML and JavaScript
## HTML
is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
**For example**, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page.


## JavaScript
**Programming with JavaScript**
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script;Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops; Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

**JavaScript Operators:**
- The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
- The addition operator (+) adds numbers.
- The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.

**In JavaScript:** consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?
