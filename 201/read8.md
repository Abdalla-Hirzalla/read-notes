# list tables and forms :
There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables, and forms.

**list-style-type**: The list-style-type property allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point (also known as a marker). It can be used on rules that apply to the ol, ul, and li elements.

**list-style-position**:
Lists are indented into the page by default and the list-styleposition property indicates whether the marker should
appear on the inside or the outside of the box containing the main points. This property can take one of
two values: **outside** and **inside**.



# Events:
HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events. An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

**Here are some examples of HTML events:**

- An HTML web page has finished loading
- An HTML input field was changed
- An HTML button was clicked
- Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

**Here is a list of some common HTML events:**
- **onchange**	An HTML element has been changed
- **onclick**	The user clicks an HTML element
- **onmouseover**	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
- **onmouseout**	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
- **onkeydown**	The user pushes a keyboard key
- **onload**	The browser has finished loading the page
