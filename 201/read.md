## Introductory HTML and JavaScript
# HTML
is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
**For example**, the element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page.

## about HTML
-  HTML pages are text documents.
-  HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

# JavaScript
**Programming with JavaScript**
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script;Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops; Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

**JavaScript Operators:**
- The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
- The addition operator (+) adds numbers.
- The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.

**JavaScript has the following types of operators:**
- Assignment operators.
- Comparison operators.
- Arithmetic operators.
- Bitwise operators.
- Logical operators.
- String operators.
