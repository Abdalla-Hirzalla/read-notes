# More CSS Layout:

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
Containing Elements : If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

CSS has the following **positioning schemes** that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can 
also float elements using the float property:

  - Normal flow:position:static.
  - Relative Positioning:position:relative.
  - Absolute positioning:position:absolute.
  - Fixed Positioning: position:fixed.


## Screen Sizes

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.


## Screen Resolution

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.


## Page Sizes

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).


## Fixed Width Layouts

Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.Measurements tend to be given in pixels.


## Liquid Layouts

Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.


## Fixed width layout

To create a fixed width layout, the width of the main boxes on a page will usually be specified in pixels (and sometimes their height, too).


## The liquid layout 
uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.
