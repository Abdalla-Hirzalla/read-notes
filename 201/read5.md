# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM



## What is the hardest thing about writing code?
- Learning a new technology
- Naming things
- Testing your code
- Debugging
- Fixing bugs
- Making software maintainable

The idea behind the **Protein Tracker application** is that it allows a user to set a goal for the amount of protein to consume in a day.  The user can add protein amounts which are added to a total protein count that is tracked for that user.


when you put two puzzles with each other The same thing happens when writing code.  Writing code is a lot like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.  We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the “bigger picture” of the problem domain.



# The Document Object Model (DOM):

**is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.The document object represents your web page.If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.Below are some examples of how you can use the document object to access and manipulate HTML.**


## DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

- Core DOM - standard model for all document types

- XML DOM - standard model for XML documents

- HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents





## What is the HTML DOM?

 
**The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:**


- The HTML elements as objects

- The properties of all HTML elements

- The methods to access all HTML elements

- The events for all HTML elements

## The DOM Programming Interface
- The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).

- In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.

- The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.

- A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

- A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).


# Object Literal:
- **You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal**
- **Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines**

- **You can access object properties in two ways:**
  - objectName.propertyName
  - objectName["propertyName"]
- Objects can also have **methods**.**Methods** are actions that can be performed on objects.**Methods** are stored in properties as function definitions.
