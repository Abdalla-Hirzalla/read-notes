# Summary

## Operators And Loops 

### JavaScript
 has both **binary** and **unary** operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A **binary** operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator, **unary** operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator.

### Loops
 You can think of a **loop** as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another,
There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!).



**The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:**

- **(for)** statement.
- (do)...while statement.
- **(while)** statement.
- (labeled) statement.
- (break) statement.
- (continue) statement.
- (for...in) statement.
- (for...of) statement.

**JavaScript has the following types of operators:**

- Assignment operators.
- Comparison operators.
- Arithmetic operators.
- Bitwise operators.
- Logical operators.
- String operators.
- Conditional (ternary) operator.
- Comma operator.
- Unary operators. 


**For** A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

**for look like this :**

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

**While** A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

**while look like this :**

while (condition)
  statement
